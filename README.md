# Financial-Distress-Prediction
Financial distress prediction executed on Python (Scikit-learn)

Project Description: Conducted predictive classification models using Scikit-learn to predict financial distress while utilizing hyperparameter optimization for Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. The models aim to predict financial distress using corporate governance variables and measure the relationship between them, as well as their impact on the prediction models using SHAP plots and permutation importances.

Project Outcome: Enhanced my Python skills, gained experience using different libraries, and sharpened my Tableau skills.
